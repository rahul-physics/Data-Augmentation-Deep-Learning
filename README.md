# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNN & Data Augmentation

A robust image classification system built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, with advanced **data augmentation** techniques powered by **OpenCV** to improve model generalization and accuracy.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end image classification pipeline, focusing on enhancing performance through a variety of data augmentation methods. The goal is to improve model robustness against real-world image variations such as lighting, orientation, and scale.

## 🚀 Features

- CNN-based image classification
- OpenCV-powered data augmentation:
  - Rotation
  - Scaling
  - Flipping (horizontal/vertical)
  - Brightness adjustment
- Modular and reusable codebase
- Real-time augmentation visualization (optional)
- Evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (depending on your choice)
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
